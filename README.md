# PDFDead_bot
Telegram bot for working with pdf files

This is a pet project to improve your programming skills. At this stage of development the bot is only able to split the user's pdf files, in the future it is planned to add functionality for different actions.
Code refactoring is also required.

To use the bot:

1. git clone https://github.com/Nk0val/PDFDead_bot.git

2. In the project directory, create two folders: downloads_pdf and splited_files (this is necessary for the correct operation of the bot, in the future the choice of directories will be available)

3. change the value of BOT_TOKEN in settings/config.py

4. Run the bot pdfdead.py
